# ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

This repository is **deprecated** and retained for provenance and historical reference only.  
It demonstrates how conventional sales and purchase reporting can be extracted from the business node, even in the absence of CRM or Procurement modules.  

All future schema development and reporting services are now managed in the [tradecontrol.web](https://github.com/tradecontrol/tradecontrol.web) repository.
